              <p style={{ color: 'black', marginTop: '12px' }}>
                Over time, the contract owner will accumulate LP tokens, giving
                them control of a significant portion of the liquidity. However,
                our liquidity is locked with a publicly visible lock, and our
                intention is to always keep it locked to ensure investor safety.
                The lock is implemented through a smart contract function,
                making it impossible for anyone, including the owner, to
                withdraw the liquidity even if their account is stolen. This
                way, we can protect both our investors and liquidity.

              <p style={{ color: 'black', marginTop: '12px' }}>
                Our contract includes functions that may need to be adjusted to
                align with our long-term vision. These adjustments will always
                be made with the consensus of the community. Examples of these
                functions include the ability to change the fee structure and
                the address of the growth fund.

                The team acknowledges that our contract has been deployed and is
                now immutable. In order for the leftover BNB to have a high
                value, there needs to be a large volume of transactions.

              <p style={{ color: 'black', marginTop: '12px' }}>
                Our smart contract ownership will only be changed if we decide
                to renounce ownership, which is not our plan as we need to
                control the functions mentioned above. Even if we were to
                renounce ownership, there would be no "lock" call.

              <p style={{ color: 'black', marginTop: '12px' }}>
                When the contract is created, all of the supply goes to the
                owner even before any sale or liquidity call is made. Our
                distribution follows the tokenomics metrics and includes vesting
                locks as stated.
